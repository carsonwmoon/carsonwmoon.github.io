                                My dad designed a pair of self-standing solar panel towers and had them manufactured and installed. He then commissioned me to make them follow the sun by programming an Arduino to control the linear motors on it to follow the sun. It has worked great ever since!

                                The objective was to get as many ping pong balls into the correct goals. The max permissible ball-carrying capacity was 2. Hence, we needed a fast, accurate collect-move-aim-shoot design to win, which we did!
