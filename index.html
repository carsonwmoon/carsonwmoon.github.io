                                Programmed an Arduino and wired it to a pair of large self-standing solar panels so they follow the sun each day.

                                My dad designed a pair of self-standing solar panel towers (combined power of 8.4 kilowatts) and had them manufactured and installed. He then commissioned me to make them follow the sun.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The end result was an Arduino I programmed that frequently reads the time from an RTC clock module to know when to power on the high-voltage relay switches. 
                                The relay switches then control the linear motors on the towers to tilt them to the correct angle throughout the day. 
                                I also wired up a small LCD screen to provide useful information about it's status. It has worked great ever since!

                                The objective was to get as many ping pong balls into the correct goals. The max permissible ball-carrying capacity was 2. Hence, we needed a fast, accurate collect-move-aim-shoot design to win, which we did!

My friends and I had recently made a giant trebuchet for fun, so we decided to use it in our final video. We ended up winning the "Best Use of Engineering" award in the competition!

                                For my senior year of high school, I designed and built my own RC plane. It was something I had wanted to do for a long while, and the final-term personal project for the class was a great excuse for it. I selected the electronics, designed the plane in CAD, built it, and it flew! Now it's a great wall decoration in my parents' garage.
